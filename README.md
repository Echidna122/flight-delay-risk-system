# ✈️ Flight Delay Risk Assessment System

### A DBMS-centric decision support system that identifies flights likely to be delayed before departure using historical flight and weather data.

 The project combines:

- Relational database design for storing and analyzing operational data

- Rule-based logic to capture real airline delay factors (peak hours, weather, congestion)

- Light machine learning (logistic regression) to estimate delay probability in an explainable way

Instead of relying on complex models, the system focuses on clear logic, strong database usage, and practical system design, similar to real airline operations tools.

Results are presented through a simple dashboard that highlights low, medium, and high-risk flights to support operational decision-making.
